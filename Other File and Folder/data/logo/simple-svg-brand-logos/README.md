# Simple SVG Brand Logos

## Women Empowerment in Zanzibar

Send a little karma down the way and support women empowerment in Zanzibar by
helping to [fund the local production of reusable female hygiene
products](https://www.gofundme.com/f/women-empowerment-in-zanzibar). A very
dear friend of mine runs the project. They were already able to buy hundreds of
educational books. Sometimes, it takes so little to make a huge impact. If
you'd like to thank me or support this work, donate. Additionally, any current
and future sponsoring of my work via GitHub or other channels will flow one
hundred percent to the NGO.

## Description

A collection of simplified brand logos, including some hard to find gems. 
Oftentimes those are only available on sketchy, ad-laden download sites, are of 
poor quality and need lots of cleaning up. This repository aims to help 
developers and designers to find high quality logos of any kind in one place. 
Also, all the color is stripped so they can be used in a consistent manner.

## Contributing

Make sure you have a vector editing tool (like 
[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) or [Adobe 
Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator/) â€” I use [Affinity 
Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/)) and 
[svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo). Please be aware that by contributing, you
